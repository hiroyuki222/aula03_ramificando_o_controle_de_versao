Load up on guns, bring your friends<br>
It's fun to lose and to pretend<br>
She's over-bored and self-assured<br>
Oh, no, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out<br>
It's less dangerous<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
I feel stupid and contagious<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
A mulatto, an albino<br>
A mosquito, my libido<br>
Yeah, hey, yay

I'm worse at what I do best<br>
And for this gift I feel blessed<br>
Our little group has always been<br>
And always will until the end

Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out<br>
It's less dangerous<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
I feel stupid and contagious<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
A mulatto, an albino<br>
A mosquito, my libido<br>
Yeah, hey, yay

And I forget just why I taste<br>
Oh, yeah, I guess it makes me smile<br>
I found it hard, it's hard to find<br>
Well, whatever, nevermind

Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello, how low<br>
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out<br>
It's less dangerous<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
I feel stupid and contagious<br>
Here we are now, entertain us<br>
A mulatto, an albino<br>
A mosquito, my libido
