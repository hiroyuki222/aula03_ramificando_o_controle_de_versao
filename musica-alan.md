# Musica: Still Loving You

## Banda: Scorpions

Time<br>
It needs time<br>
To win back your love again<br>
I will be there<br>
I will be there<br>
Love<br>
Only love<br>
Can bring back your love someday<br>
I will be there<br>
I will be there<br>
Fight<br>
Babe, I'll fight<br>
To win back your love again<br>
I will be there<br>
I will be there<br>
Love<br>
Only love<br>
Can bring down the wall someday<br>
I will be there<br>
I will be there<br>
If we'd go again<br>
All the way from the start<br>
I would try to change<br>
The things that killed our love<br>
Pride has built a wall, so strong<br>
That I can't get through<br>
Is there really no chance<br>
To start once again?<br>
I'm loving you<br>
Try<br>
Baby, try<br>
To trust in my love again<br>
I will be there<br>
I will be there<br>
Love<br>
Our love<br>
Just shouldn't be thrown away<br>
I will be there<br>
I will be there<br>
If we'd go again<br>
All the way from the start<br>
I would try to change<br>
The things that killed our love<br>
Pride has built a wall, so strong<br>
That I can't get through<br>
Is there really no chance<br>
To start once again?<br>
If we'd go again<br>
All the way from the start<br>
I would try to change<br>
The things that killed our love<br>
Yes, I've hurt your pride and I know<br>
What you've been through<br>
You should give me a chance<br>
This can't be the end<br>
I'm still loving you<br>
I'm still loving you<br>
I'm still loving you<br>
I need your love<br>
I'm still loving you<br>
Still loving you, baby<br>
I'm still loving you<br>
I need your love<br>
I'm still loving you<br>
I need your love<br>
Hoo!<br>
I'm still loving you<br>
I need your love<br>
Hoo!<br>
I need your love
