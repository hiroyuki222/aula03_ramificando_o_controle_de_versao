Still Loving You
Scorpions
Time
It needs time
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love
Only love
Can bring back your love someday
I will be there
I will be there
Fight
Babe, I'll fight
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love
Only love
Can bring down the wall someday
I will be there
I will be there
If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
The things that killed our love
Pride has built a wall, so strong
That I can't get through
Is there really no chance
To start once again?
I'm loving you
Try
Baby, try
To trust in my love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love
Our love
Just shouldn't be thrown away
I will be there
I will be there
If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
The things that killed our love
Pride has built a wall, so strong
That I can't get through
Is there really no chance
To start once again?
If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
The things that killed our love
Yes, I've hurt your pride and I know
What you've been through
You should give me a chance
This can't be the end
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I need your love
I'm still loving you
Still loving you, baby
I'm still loving you
I need your love
I'm still loving you
I need your love
Hoo!
I'm still loving you
I need your love
Hoo!
I need your love



Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit
I made my first million, I'm like: Shit, this is it
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like: Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said: Can I have some to hold?
And I can't ever tell you no

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Ty Dolla $ign]
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh, no, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out
It's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Yeah, hey, yay

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out
It's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido
Yeah, hey, yay

And I forget just why I taste
Oh, yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Well, whatever, nevermind

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out
It's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

A denial, a denial, a denial
A denial, a denial, a denial
