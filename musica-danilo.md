# Musica: Psycho (feat. Ty Dolla $ign)

## Banda: Post Malone

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael<br>
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you<br>
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload<br>
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos<br>
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael<br>
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you<br>
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload<br>
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth<br>
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit<br>
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit<br>
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit<br>
I made my first million, I'm like: Shit, this is it<br>
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit<br>
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip<br>
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'<br>
And I'm like: Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold<br>
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked<br>
I got homies, let it go, oh<br>
My money thick, won't ever fold<br>
She said: Can I have some to hold?<br>
And I can't ever tell you no

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael<br>
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you<br>
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload<br>
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos<br>
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael<br>
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you<br>
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload<br>
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

[Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy<br>
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies<br>
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky<br>
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch<br>
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top<br>
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top<br>
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop<br>
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop<br>
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo<br>
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico<br>
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums<br>
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright<br>
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though<br>
All VVS', put you in a necklace<br>
Girl, you look beautiful tonight<br>
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry
